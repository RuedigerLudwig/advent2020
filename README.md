# Advent of Code 2020

These are my solutions for [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/). Thanks to [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl) for great puzzles and a great time.

This is the first year I really tried this and I choose python 3.9 as the programming language. The only non standard library I used was regex for my second solution on day 19.

My goal was to finished on day one every day, in which I succeeded. Plus I also wanted to keep to a consistent coding style. All mayor funtions were tested first. In that regard I was pretty sure I would have the correct solution before running the `__main__.py` module each day and especially before committing. This mostly did work out as planned.

Thanks have to go to Heiko, my great husband who suggested to take part this year. Also my second solution on day 19 is heavily inspired by his solution.

Here are my stats for the whole event:
